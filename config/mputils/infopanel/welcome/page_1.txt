Welcome to Scientia!

Scientia is designed to give the player a new and unique Minecraft experience.

The progression system is based on Advancements - Access it with §4L§f

Advancements are grouped up into 3 categories:
- §9Normal§f
- §5Research§f
- §2Profession§f

The chain of Advancements that lead to the next chapter have rounded edges.


The fullscreen map from §bJourneymap§f can be accessed with §4J§f, but the other functions must be unlocked through a Research Advancement.


The majority of blocks and items are §8hidden§f until unlocked.


To share Advancements and Gamestages with others, use the mod §9Together Forever§f, and check the commands beginning with §9/tf§f


This information and changelogs can be accessed again by pausing the game and clicking the §aInfo§f icon on the right side of the screen.
