In order for this to work, you need a very hot heat source. Lava should do the trick, you just need to discover some first.\n\nYou've come up with two variants to the Crucible, each with a different look. Obtaining any of their blueprints will complete this advancement.\nNote: You need to progress further to build this machine.")
