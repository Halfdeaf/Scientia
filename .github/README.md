You start at the Dawn of Time, and have to discover new skills, resources and technologies in order to progress.

Colaborate with villages and rival other settlements on your journey towards understanding the world.

*   Learn Professions and master them to gain access to new abilities and recipes.  
*   The progression is guided by a thorough Advancement system.
*   Unique items, recipes and dimensions.
*   A large assortment of both Magic and Tech content.

### <span style="font-size: 24px;">Media</span>

*   You may NOT make Scientia content as this time.

### <span style="font-size: 24px;">Testing</span>

Join the Scientia Discord, and ask for permission to test the modpack. If accepted, follow these steps to setup the modpack:

1) Download the latest manifest from the #files channel
2) Import the manifest to Twitch or MultiMC

You're done!

There are a few things I would like testers to consider/look for:

* Bugs of course, gotta squash 'em all.
* Things you find boring/tedious
* Things that need small optimizations, such as advancement text and textures.

I would also appreciate if you let me know what you think of the gameplay, especially if you didn't like it :)

### <span style="font-size: 24px;">Contributing</span>

Join the Scientia Discord, and ask for permission to contribute to the modpack. If accepted, follow these steps to setup your workspace:

1) Fork the Scientia repository.
2) Clone your fork to your PC, I recommend using [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).
3) Download the latest manifest.zip from the `files` channel in the Discord.
4) Import the manifest.zip using Twitch or MultiMC.
5) Move the `mods` folder from your imported instance into the folder you made in step 2.

You're done!

To update, the steps are as follow:

1) Pull from master from the Scientia repository into your fork.
2) Delete the mods folder from your local instance.
3) Repeat steps 3-5 from the setup.
