Join the Scientia Discord, and ask for permission to contribute/test the modpack. If accepted, follow these steps to setup your workspace:

3) Download the latest manifest.zip from the `files` channel in the Discord.
4) Import the manifest.zip using Twitch or MultiMC.
5) Move the `mods` folder from your imported instance into the folder you made in step 2.

You're done!

To update, the steps are as follow:
