### <span style="font-size: 24px;">Contributing</span>

Join the Scientia Discord, and ask for permission to contribute/test the modpack. If accepted, follow these steps to setup your workspace:

1) Fork the Scientia repository
2) Clone your fork to your PC, I recommend using [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
3) Download the latest manifest.zip from the `files` channel in the Discord
4) Import the manifest.zip using Twitch or MultiMC
5) Move the `mods` folder from your imported instance into the folder you made in step 2)

You're done!

To update, the steps are as follow:

1) Pull from master from the Scientia repository into your fork
2) Delete the mods folder from your local instance
3) Repeat steps 3-5 from the setup
